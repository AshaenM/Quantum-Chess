# Quantum Chess Project
## Overview
The Quantum Chess Project is an innovative take on the classic chess game, integrating quantum mechanics principles. Players can explore unique mechanics such as superposition and quantum measurement, blending strategy with scientific concepts. This project aims to create an engaging gameplay experience while also demonstrating the application of quantum mechanics in game development.

# Features
- Quantum Superposition: Pieces can exist in multiple states until measured.
- Quantum Measurement Techniques: Various approaches to determine a piece's state are implemented and analyzed.
- Classical Chess Mechanics: Retains the foundational rules of chess for familiarity.
- Performance Analysis: Metrics to evaluate the efficiency and strategic value of different measurement techniques.
- Interactive Gameplay: Visual representation of quantum states, allowing players to make informed decisions.

# Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Game Framework: Pygame
- Development Environment: Visual Studio Code

# How to Play
- Download python and pygame libraries
- Run main.py
- Left click a piece to select it and left click on a square to move it
- Left click a piece and then right click on 2 squares to superpose it
- Middle Click 2 superposed pieces and then left click on a square to merge them.
